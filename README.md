# CS464-Image-Caption Generator
*Development Stage*
Image Captioning using Pretrained Feature Extraction with LSTM and Transformer Architectures 

This project is under active development, and the following components have been implemented or are in progress:

-Feature Extraction: Using pre-trained models like ResNet or YOLO for extracting features from images.
-Caption Generation: Exploring different architectures, including LSTMs and Transformers for generating captions from image features.
-Dataset: Using the COCO dataset for training and evaluation.
-Evaluation Metrics: The system will support evaluation using metrics like BLEU and METEOR.


**Development Progress**
*Completed:*
Imports and Resolving Compatibility Issues
Initializing of Pretrained YOLO model
Basic training and evaluation setup.
*In Progress:*
Preprocessing of images and annotations from the COCO dataset.
Implementing various evaluation metrics (BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR).
Hyperparameter tuning and optimization of the caption generator.
*Planned:*
Experimenting with Transformer models for caption generation
Implementing more advanced techniques like attention mechanisms and beam search.
